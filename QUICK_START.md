## 🚀 Two Steps to Deploy

### Step 1: Commit and Push (Do this now)

```bash
git commit -m "Deploy unified Luminate Cookbook with multi-page navigation"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Update Streamlit Cloud (Then do this)

1. Go to https://share.streamlit.io
2. Click on your **emailbanners** app
3. Change **Main file** from `streamlit_app.py` to `app.py`
4. Click **Save**
5. Wait 2-5 minutes for deployment
6. Visit https://emailbanners.streamlit.app/ to verify

## ✅ What's Ready

All files are staged and ready:
- ✅ New unified app (`app.py`)
- ✅ Email Banner Processor page
- ✅ Image Uploader page
- ✅ All dependencies verified
- ✅ Documentation updated

## 📋 After Deployment
